# AntFarm
An artificial neural network driven by genetic algorithm.

---

This is an **attempt** in ANN.  
It kinda works... The ants "sense" the food in the box (through 2 sensors in the head and 1 in abdomen) and the ANN tries to steer the ant in the correct direction.  
The biggest current issue is in the GA part, where the learning is very weak and erratic, though it works.
